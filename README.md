# corona_caveman

Corona Caveman is a Vue.js project designed to collect donations in order to provide food to hungry elemenentary school schildren.

I built this website with the intent of creating a template for Give Lively widgets. We were unable to find any suitable website options that worked with Give Lively, so I decided to build a website around the widget. Using Vue-router and Vuetify, I created an easily customizable website to provide more information and reasons to donate. This website is hosted through GitHub Pages.

100% of the money we raise goes directly to Blessings in a Backpack, a nonprofit organization that provides food to elementary school children across America who might otherwise go hungry. We are a group of friends looking to make a difference during difficult times and bring people together while in isolation. With these goals in mind, we created a platform to help feed children from the comfort and safety of our own homes. Why do we do it? To feed the kids and ensure that childhood hunger becomes a thing of the past.
